# What is Helio Networks?

Helio Networks is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization powered by a community of hobbyists. You may know us better as `HelioHost`, the name of our free full-featured web hosting service.

Founded in February of 2005 by [Ashoat Tesyovan](../misc/staff/ashoat.md), we began as a generic discussion board called `HelioNet` where anyone could discuss almost anything.

Shortly after our founding, we created `HelioHost`, a free "Post to Host" members-only web hosting service. 

Over time, we refocused our efforts on the web hosting aspects of our services, and dropped the requirement to post on the forums in exchange for free hosting.

[HelioNet](https://helionet.org/) now serves as the main support site for [HelioHost](https://heliohost.org/), with nearly 200k members on the forum.

We offer free community-powered technical support, coding help, and other general conversation topics that are open to participation by all our members.
